🚀 Introducing Cred Fill: A Credential Manager for Developers 🔑

As developers, we juggle multiple projects, app variants, and users with varying levels of access daily. Managing credentials for all of these can be a hassle—and that’s where Cred Fill comes in!

💡 What is Cred Fill?
I built a desktop application using Kotlin Compose Multiplatform to help developers seamlessly manage and autofill credentials. With Cred Fill, you can:
✅ Organize credentials by project.
✅ Quickly add, edit, or delete credentials.
✅ Import/export credential data for backup and sharing.
✅ Toggle password visibility for security.
✅ Autofill credentials for faster logins while testing apps.

💻 Why I Built It
While working on multiple Android projects with various app variants, I noticed how much time was wasted manually managing and entering test credentials. Cred Fill eliminates this friction, letting developers focus on what they do best—building amazing apps!

🌟 Upcoming Features
I’m actively working on making Cred Fill even better with these enhancements:
🔍 Search & Filter: Quickly find credentials or projects with search and filter options.
📌 Favorites/Pinning: Pin frequently used credentials to the top for faster access.
🏷️ Grouping/Tagging: Organize credentials by type (e.g., admin, test, user) with tags or groups.
🎨 Custom Themes: Choose between dark mode or custom themes to match your workflow.

🔮 Future Vision
I aim to make Cred Fill an indispensable tool for developers by adding security features like encryption, cloud sync for cross-device use, and seamless IDE integration for even more productivity.
