🚀 Introducing Cred Fill: A Credential Manager for Developers 🔑 <br>

As developers, we juggle multiple projects, app variants, and users with varying levels of access daily. Managing credentials for all of these can be a hassle—and that’s where Cred Fill comes in! <br>

💡 What is Cred Fill? <br>
I built a desktop application using Kotlin Compose Multiplatform to help developers seamlessly manage and autofill credentials. With Cred Fill, you can: <br>
✅ Organize credentials by project. <br>
✅ Quickly add, edit, or delete credentials. <br>
✅ Import/export credential data for backup and sharing. <br>
✅ Toggle password visibility for security. <br>
✅ Autofill credentials for faster logins while testing apps. <br>

💻 Why I Built It <br>
While working on multiple Android projects with various app variants, I noticed how much time was wasted manually managing and entering test credentials. Cred Fill eliminates this friction, letting developers focus on what they do best—building amazing apps! <br>

🌟 Upcoming Features <br>
I’m actively working on making Cred Fill even better with these enhancements: <br>
🔍 Search & Filter: Quickly find credentials or projects with search and filter options. <br>
📌 Favorites/Pinning: Pin frequently used credentials to the top for faster access. <br>
🏷️ Grouping/Tagging: Organize credentials by type (e.g., admin, test, user) with tags or groups. <br>
🎨 Custom Themes: Choose between dark mode or custom themes to match your workflow. <br>

🔮 Future Vision <br>
I aim to make Cred Fill an indispensable tool for developers by adding security features like encryption, cloud sync for cross-device use, and seamless IDE integration for even more productivity. <br>
